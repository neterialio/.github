#### About

We help early-stage startups focused on developing their MVP to save money on cloud services.
Entrepreneurs often struggle to deploy cloud infrastructure for their MVP in the most cost-efficient way.
Options such as AWS, GCP, Azure may not be viable due to their extremely high costs, even with free tiers available.
Alternatively, other solutions may require expertise to deploy all the necessary tools on your own.

Our cloud-agnostic platform helps to efficiently set up and manage Kubernetes, databases, and beyond,
leveraging affordable cloud providers like Hetzner, OVH, Linode, Digital Ocean, etc.

Our mission is to provide cost-effective Cloud Management Platform that prioritize financial efficiency
and cloud independence for startups, especially for bootstraps. We aim to help Customers reduce their
initial cloud infrastructure expenses and maintain freedom in their long-term cloud strategy,
which is crucial for scaling their products without being constrained by specific cloud providers.
